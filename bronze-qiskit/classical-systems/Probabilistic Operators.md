# Playing with Matrixes
Let's assume a situation: Some conditions are provided::
Probabilistic_Operators
whenever she gets a `head`, one euro is flipped;

whenever she gets a `tail`, one cent is flipped; and

Start with flipping one euro giving `head` from nowhere

She starts with State 0; That is Head while State 1 represents Tail.

Whole concept of Probablistic Operaters (explained through a single photograph)

## Stochastic Matrix
each entry non-negative; the summattion of each entry in each column is equal to 1.

## Transition probability
Finding transition probability from example `the second state to the third state` in a 3*3 Matrix is shown below.

It justs points to 3.2 element of the matrix
