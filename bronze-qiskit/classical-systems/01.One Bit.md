# Bit (or binary digit) 
is the basic unit of information used in computer science and information theory.

It can also be seen as the smallest "useful" memory unit, which has two states named 0 and 1.
Current states (single bits) either contain 0 & 1.

## Different Operators

We can apply four different operators to a single bit:

```ruby
1. Identity: 𝐼(0)=0  and  𝐼(1)=1 
2. Negation: 𝑁𝑂𝑇(0)=1  and  𝑁𝑂𝑇(1)=0 
3. Constant (Zero): 𝑍𝐸𝑅𝑂(0)=0  and  𝑍𝐸𝑅𝑂(1)=0 
4. Constant (One):  𝑂𝑁𝐸(0)=1  and  𝑂𝑁𝐸(1)=1
```
## Classification of Operators
Which are themselves clear from there names.

Based on this observation, we can classify the operators into two types: Reversible and Irreversible.

If we can recover the initial value(s) from the final value(s), then the operator is called reversible like Identity and NOT operators.
If we cannot know the initial value(s) from the final value(s), then the operator is called irreversible like ZERO and ONE operators.
